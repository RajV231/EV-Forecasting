# ⚡ EV Infrastructure Forecast & Planning Dashboard

A geospatial analytics tool that forecasts electric vehicle (EV) adoption and identifies the charger deployment gap across major Indian cities.
This project helps policymakers, charging companies, and infrastructure planners determine where new charging stations are most urgently needed.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes:

* Population density
* EV penetration trends
* Forecasted EV growth over the next 5 years
* Installed vs required EV chargers
* City-wise charger deployment priority

The result is an interactive dashboard that visualizes EV demand using a heat map and dynamic charts.

Users can explore:

* Which cities will have the highest EV count
* How many more chargers each city needs
* Market readiness and infrastructure gap
* High-priority expansion zones

## 🧠 Forecast Modeling

The forecast uses a compounded annual growth calculation:

```
Future EVs = Current EVs × (1 + growth_rate)^years
```

Assumptions based on market growth trends and national EV policy trajectories.

Charging demand assumes:

```
1 charger per ~400 EVs
```

This ratio can be tuned for different deployment strategies.

## 🏆 Insights Example

Example insight generated by the system:

> *Mumbai is expected to reach ~257k EVs by 2029 and requires approximately 643 charging stations. With only 264 existing stations, the city covers ~41% of projected demand, indicating a **high expansion priority**.*
